GIT-REVIEW(1)

NAME
        git-review - List the modified files in the workspace and view each in Vim.

SYNOPSIS
        git review [args]

DESCRIPTION
        List the modified files that in the workspace.

        In addition, files can be opened in the Vim editor in horizontally or vertically split
        windows (or none), and the number of files passed to STDOUT or Vim can be limited.

        A search of the commit files can be performed using a regular expression so that only
        those files will be targeted.

        Note that invoking the command without any arguments is the same as doing `git ls-files -m`.

            - List the files that make up the latest commit.

        git review --edit v

        git review -edit b -limit 4
            - Opens all listed files in Vim (in buffers), limiting the number of files opened to
              the first four.

        git review -e h -l 3
            - Opens all listed files in horizontally-split windows, limiting the number of files
              opened to the first three.
