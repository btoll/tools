GIT-CLEANUP(1)

NAME
        git-cleanup - Delete local and remote branches that have been merged or unmerged and match the given filter.

SYNOPSIS
        git cleanup [-l] [ --no-merged ] [ --no-remote-delete ] [ -p pattern ] [ -f file ] [ -r remote ] [ -i interactive ]

DESCRIPTION
        This script will delete any git branch, both locally and remotely, that has been merged or unmerged and that matches the filtered search.
        If unsure about which branches your fuzzy search will match and delete, it is recommended to first do a dry run.

        This uses the git command `git branch --merged` under the covers.

        This does the following:
        - will delete all branches that match the filter, both local and remote
        - uses getopts, so will accept arguments in any order

        Note that you can also define the following environment variables used by the script:

            GIT_CLEANUP_PATTERN
            GIT_CLEANUP_REPO

        The biggest fear is of accidentally deleting a branch that hasn't been merged yet, and the most likely scenario for
        this is that of an unpushed branch. This is mitigated by the program warning you if the branch you're on is in the
        list of merged branches.

        The only scenarios in which a local branch will be deleted is when it contains no commits.

        The script will not force delete (`-D`) any branches!

OPTIONS
        -h  Help

        -f  It's possible to specify a file to which all of the git branch deletion commands will be written.
            This will not delete any branches. It's intention is to allow for further inspection of all the
            deletion candidates. The file will be executable.

        -i  Interactive mode.

        -l  Will operate in DRY RUN mode.  Will list all branches to be deleted.
            This is useful (and safe) when you are not sure which branches will be removed by the filter.

        --no-merged Operate on unmerged branches instead.

        --no-remote-delete Do not delete the branches remotely.

        -p  The pattern to use for existing local branches.
            Defaults to '.'

        -r  The name of the remote repository from which to delete the branch.
            Defaults to 'origin'.

EXAMPLES
        git cleanup [defaults to -r origin -f EXTJS.*]
        git cleanup -r origin
        git cleanup -p "HELLO.*"
        git cleanup -p "WORLD.*" -r btoll
        git cleanup --no-merged -f delete.sh
        git cleanup --no-merged -i
