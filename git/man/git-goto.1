GIT-GOTO(1)

NAME
        git-goto - Checkout the hash of any tagged commit.

SYNOPSIS
        git goto [tagname]

DESCRIPTION
        This is most useful when needing to quickly check out a release without having to know the tagged hash.
        Note that you can pass just the version number or the full tag name.

        It can be useful when bisecting or checking out a tagged version.

EXAMPLES
        git goto 4.2.2
