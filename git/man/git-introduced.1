GIT-INTRODUCED(1)

NAME
        git-introduced - Find the commit(s) that introduced or removed a method or other search pattern.

SYNOPSIS
        git introduced [ -p pattern ] [ -l location ] [ --open-in-browser ] [ --no-delete-file ]

DESCRIPTION
        It is basically a wrapper for ```git log -S``` and return the same results, however there are several advantages to it:

            - Opens all search results in its own tabbed browser window.
              This can be incredibly useful when discussing an issue with a colleague over the internets.
              Currently only supported on Mac OS X.

            - Ease of typing.
              Since it provides sensible defaults for the formatting, it's not necessary to lookup the tokens to
              provide your own. In addition, it will automatically use the current working directory as the search
              location (as the last argument after the ```--```) which can significantly speed up the query.

              The found matches will be in the following format (to STDOUT):

                  Hash (short)    ->  6449ce9
                  Author name     ->  Benjamin Toll
                  Author email    ->  benjam72@yahoo.com
                  Commit message  ->  Ensure column filter menu is destroyed when adding new column filters.
                  Merge date      ->  Mon Nov 24 13:27:27 2014 -0500
                  Url             ->  https://github.com/extjs/SDK/commit/6449ce9

            - Will keep the auto-generated CSV file on disk by passing the ```--no-delete-file``` flag.
