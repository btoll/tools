GIT-LS(1)

NAME
        git-ls - List the files that make up any given commit.

SYNOPSIS
        git ls [args]

DESCRIPTION
        List the files that make up any given commit.  Will default to HEAD unless another
        commit is specified.

        In addition, files can be opened in the Vim editor in horizontally or vertically split
        windows (or none), and the number of files passed to STDOUT or Vim can be limited.

        A search of the commit files can be performed using a regular expression so that only
        those files will be targeted.

EXAMPLES
        git ls
            - List the files that make up the latest commit.

        git ls --edit v
            - Opens all listed files in Vim in vertically-split windows.

        git ls --commit HEAD -e t
            - Opens all listed files in Vim in tabs for the specified hash (note that it will default to HEAD).

        git ls -edit b -limit 4
            - Opens all listed files in Vim (in buffers), limiting the number of files opened to
              the first four.

        git ls -c cf457b6 -e h -l 3
            - Opens all listed files for the specified hash (cf457b6) in horizontally-split windows,
              limiting the number of files opened to the first three.

        git ls -c cf457b6 -pattern debugger -e h -l 3
            - Opens all listed files for the specified hash (cf457b6) that match the specified regular expression
              in horizontally-split windows, limiting the number of files opened to the first three.
