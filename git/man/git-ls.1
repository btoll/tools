GIT-LS(1)

NAME
        git-ls - List the files that are staged and modifed or that make up any given commit and
        optionally open in Vim for editing.

SYNOPSIS
        git ls [args]

DESCRIPTION
        List the files that make up any given commit or that have been staged or modified.  Will
        default to HEAD unless another commit is specified.

        In addition, files can be opened in the Vim editor in horizontally or vertically split
        windows, tabs, or plain buffers.

        A search of the commit files can be performed using a regular expression so that only
        those files will be targeted.

EXAMPLES
        git ls
            - List the files that make up the latest commit.

        git ls --dirty
            - List the files that are in the staged area and are modified in the workspace.

        git ls --edit v
            - Opens all listed files in Vim in vertically-split windows.

        git ls --commit HEAD -e t
            - Opens all listed files in Vim in tabs for the specified hash (note that it will default to HEAD).

        git ls -edit b
            - Opens all listed files in Vim (in buffers).

        git ls -c cf457b6 -e h
            - Opens all listed files for the specified hash (cf457b6) in horizontally-split windows.

        git ls -c cf457b6 -pattern debugger -e h
